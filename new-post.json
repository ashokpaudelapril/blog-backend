  "content": "And those eyes, for once I thought, if only I could look into those eyes for long. Just looking through them, I lose the sense of time. Even if I don't, I want to. It seems like, it feels like something different. You hold your sigh and release it. I wish I could stay, just sit and observe her in a way that’s hard to explain.\n\nWhile the world runs at its own pace, I want to stay and relive those moments as if someone left them there and no one else saw what I saw in those eyes that force me to question my own existence.\n\nFor once I thought, if something can be so beautiful, so full of pleasure, why doesn't the world care to see what lies beyond the surface? I wonder what the world is chasing if something so beautiful can be found in someone’s eyes.\n\nI must say, your eyes are like glimpses of mountains, so distant and majestic. As if you could conquer them, but don’t want to own them, just so they can remain as they are. I stand at a corner, watching how they play around. To conquer, to see them endlessly, not to possess them, but to set them free.\n\nBut I am no one to set them free, no one to conquer them. Yet I feel as if someone will steal them from me. As if they’ll be gone, like a child chasing a butterfly through a barren field. Eventually, it will fly away.\n\nI feel the chase for you within me. I don’t want to catch you. Maybe the thirst itself is the real satisfaction. If it were ever quenched, it might disappear. I just want you to keep me chasing, without exhaustion. As if I almost catch up, yet never do.\n\nBut with the pace at which the world is running, and the weight I carry, will I be able to chase you forever? If you were there for just a split second, would you still leave a void in my heart forever?\n\nOh… can I live with that void? For once, eyes don’t lie, do they?",
